  --candidates=CANDIDATES
                        connection information for candidate slave servers for
                        failover in the form:
                        <user>[:<password>]@<host>[:<port>][:<socket>] or
                        <login-path>[:<port>][:<socket>] or <config-
                        path>[<[group]>] Valid only with failover command.
                        List multiple slaves in comma-separated list.
  --discover-slaves-login=DISCOVER
                        at startup, query master for all registered slaves and
                        use the user name and password specified to connect.
                        Supply the user and password in the form
                        <user>[:<password>] or <login-path>. For example,
                        --discover-slaves-login=joe:secret will use 'joe' as
                        the user and 'secret' as the password for each
                        discovered slave.
  --exec-after=EXEC_AFTER
                        name of script to execute after failover or switchover
  --exec-before=EXEC_BEFORE
                        name of script to execute before failover or
                        switchover
  --log=LOG_FILE        specify a log file to use for logging messages
  --log-age=LOG_AGE     specify maximum age of log entries in days. Entries
                        older than this will be purged on startup. Default = 7
                        days.
  --master=MASTER       connection information for master server in the form:
                        <user>[:<password>]@<host>[:<port>][:<socket>] or
                        <login-path>[:<port>][:<socket>] or <config-
                        path>[<[group]>].
  --max-position=MAX_POSITION
                        used to detect slave delay. The maximum difference
                        between the master's log position and the slave's
                        reported read position of the master. A value greater
                        than this means the slave is too far behind the
                        master. Default is 0.
  --ping=PING           Number of ping attempts for detecting downed server.
  --seconds-behind=MAX_DELAY
                        used to detect slave delay. The maximum number of
                        seconds behind the master permitted before slave is
                        considered behind the master. Default is 0.
  --slaves=SLAVES       connection information for slave servers in the form:
                        <user>[:<password>]@<host>[:<port>][:<socket>] or
                        <login-path>[:<port>][:<socket>] or <config-
                        path>[<[group]>]. List multiple slaves in comma-
                        separated list.
  --timeout=TIMEOUT     maximum timeout in seconds to wait for each
                        replication command to complete. For example, timeout
                        for slave waiting to catch up to master. Default =
                        300.
  --script-threshold=SCRIPT_THRESHOLD
                        Value for external scripts to trigger aborting the
                        operation if result is greater than or equal to the
                        threshold. Default = None (no threshold checking).
  -i INTERVAL, --interval=INTERVAL
                        interval in seconds for polling the master for failure
                        and reporting health. Default = 15 seconds. Lowest
                        value is 5 seconds.
  -f FAILOVER_MODE, --failover-mode=FAILOVER_MODE
                        action to take when the master fails. 'auto' =
                        automatically fail to best slave, 'elect' = fail to
                        candidate list or if no candidate meets criteria fail,
                        'fail' = take no action and stop when master fails.
                        Default = 'auto'.
  --exec-fail-check=EXEC_FAIL
                        name of script to execute on each interval to invoke
                        failover
  --force               override the registration check on master for multiple
                        instances of the console monitoring the same master.
  --exec-post-failover=EXEC_POST_FAIL
                        name of script to execute after failover is complete
                        and the utility has refreshed the health report.
  -p, --pedantic        fail if some inconsistencies are found (e.g. errant
                        transactions on slaves).
  --no-keyboard         start with no keyboard input support.
  --daemon=DAEMON       run on daemon mode. It can be start, stop, restart or
                        nodetach.
  --pidfile=PIDFILE     pidfile for running mysqlfailover as a daemon.
  --report-values=REPORT_VALUES
                        report values used in mysqlfailover running as a
                        daemon. It can be health, gtid or uuid. Multiple
                        values can be used separated by commas. The default is
                        health.
  --connection-timeout=CONN_TIMEOUT
                        set the connection timeout for TCP and Unix socket
                        connections for all master, slaves, and candidate
                        slaves specified. Default is 10 as provided in the
                        Connector/Python module.
  --master-fail-retry=FAIL_RETRY
                        time in seconds to wait to determine master is down.
                        The failover check will be run again when the retry
                        delay expires. Can be used to introduce a longer
                        period between when master is detected as unavailable
                        to declaring it down. This option is not used with
                        --exec-fail-check.
  -v, --verbose         control how much information is displayed. e.g., -v =
                        verbose, -vv = more verbose, -vvv = debug
  --rpl-user=RPL_USER   the user and password for the replication user
                        requirement, in the form: <user>[:<password>] or
                        <login-path>. E.g. rpl:passwd
  --ssl-ca=SSL_CA       path to a file that contains a list of trusted SSL
                        CAs.
  --ssl-cert=SSL_CERT   name of the SSL certificate file to use for
                        establishing a secure connection.
  --ssl-key=SSL_KEY     name of the SSL key file to use for establishing a
                        secure connection.
  --ssl=SSL             specifies if the server connection requires use of
                        SSL. If an encrypted connection cannot be established,
                        the connection attempt fails. By default 0 (SSL not
                        required).
